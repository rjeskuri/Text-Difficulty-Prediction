The goal of this project was to utilize several superivsed and unsupervised learning methods to classify wikipedia sentences as being easy or difficult to read.  The over 200k labeled training examples and 100k test set were provided by the University of Michigan in conjunction with Simple Wikipedia.  

Data cleaning was performed using Regex and Python. 30+ features were engineeered using NLTK and SpaCy.
